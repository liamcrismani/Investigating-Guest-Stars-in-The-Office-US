# Investigating-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office-US
A DataCamp project to practice pandas data manipulation and visualisation with matplotlib.

In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. 
To do so, we will use the following dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset

The Office! What started as a British mockumentary series about office culture in 2001 has since spawned ten other variants across the world, 
including an Israeli version (2010-13), a Hindi version (2019-), and even a French Canadian variant (2006-2007). Of all these iterations (including the original), 
the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.
